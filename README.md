# BST-Memory-Management
Usage:
In a terminal
./PJ3 <Flag>
The flag is either a 0 or a 1. When it is a 1 it will cause a new node to be taken from a local list rather than allocating memory for each added node.

Once running:
Use any of the commands below
Stop
(stops the program)

PreOrder 0
(prints tree in pre-order ignoring null nodes)

PreOrder 1
(prints tree in pre-order with null nodes)

InOrder 0
(prints tree in in-order ignoring null nodes)

InOrder 1
(prints tree in in-order with null nodes)

PostOrder 0
(prints tree in post-order ignoring null nodes)

PostOrder 1
(prints tree in post-order with null nodes)

Read <FileName>
(When the BST size is 0, read the BST stored in the file)

Write <FileName>
(Writes the tree in pre-order into the file)

Maximum
(gets the max value)

Minimum
(gets the minimum value)

Search <Key>
(searches the tree for a node with the value key)

Insert <Key>
(inserts a new node with the value key unless a node with the value exists already)

Delete <Key>
(Deletes a node with the value of key)

PrintList <Count>
(Prints the first <Count> values in the BST)
